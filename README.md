# Anomaly Detection System

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive Anomaly Detection System designed to identify and analyze anomalies within time-series data. Utilizing a blend of rule-based algorithms, univariate and multivariate techniques, the system offers an effective approach to detect outliers. With the integration of KMeans clustering and DBSCAN methods, it caters to diverse datasets, highlighting its adaptability and robustness in handling real-world data challenges.

## Features
- **Preprocessing:** Handles missing values and normalizes the dataset to ensure quality analysis.
- **Rule-based Detection:** Implements basic anomaly detection based on predefined thresholds.
- **Univariate Analysis:** Uses Isolation Forest for detecting anomalies within individual data features.
- **Multivariate Analysis:** Employs KMeans and DBSCAN for comprehensive anomaly detection across multiple features.
- **Visualization:** Provides insightful visualizations of the data and detected anomalies using Matplotlib and Plotly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system along with pip for package management.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/drpiha/AnomalyDetectionSystem.git
